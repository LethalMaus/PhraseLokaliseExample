## Introduction

Localization is a crucial aspect of app development to ensure that your app can reach a wider audience by supporting multiple languages and regions. The Phrase SDK and Lokalise SDK are powerful tools that streamline the localization process by providing features like string management, translation workflows, and real-time collaboration with translators.

This demo app aims to illustrate how to integrate the Phrase SDK and Lokalise SDK into your Android application. It includes two build variants, one for each SDK, allowing you to compare and contrast the implementation and functionality of both.

## Features

- Two build variants: Phrase SDK and Lokalise SDK
- Demonstrates integration of the respective SDKs for localization
- Displays localized strings in different languages
- Easy management of translations and localization workflows
- Real-time collaboration with translators
- Simplified string management and synchronization
